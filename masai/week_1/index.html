    <p style="font-size:22px;"> <b> The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa</b>, often simply referred to as <b> Timon & Pumbaa</b>, is an American animated television series created by Walt Disney Television Animation. Based on the 1994 Disney animated film The Lion King, it centers on Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog, as they live their problem-free philosophy Hakuna Matata. The show ran for three seasons on CBS, Disney Channel, Toon Disney, and in syndication as a part of The Disney Afternoon. It aired from September 8, 1995 to September 24, 1999. It is also the first The Lion King-related media to feature humans, as humans did not appear in the film and its sequels. It is the first of two television series to be based on the film, the second being The Lion Guard.<br>
